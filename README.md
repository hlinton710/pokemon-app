## Reflection
I enjoyed attempting this project, although I didn't achieve as much as I had hoped, I ran into a few challenges beyond my expertise as I am not fully competent in ReactJS. Although It has given me a good insight and practice with ReactJS.

I started this process by using the 'create-react-app' boilerplate. Then I Installed Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies via npm, and ran the init command to generate both 'tailwind.config.js' and 'postcss.config.js'.
